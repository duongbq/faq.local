I have added 3 version, mootools, jquery and simple javascript version. Before running the application, please follow the steps below.

1. Execute the dbscript.txt file in mysql database.

2. open dbconnection.php file and change the following,
	$db_host		= 'localhost';
	$db_user		= 'username';
	$db_pass		= 'password';
	$db_database		= 'databasename';

3. Now for accessing javascript version use index_javascript_version.php, for running mootools version use index_mootools_version.php, for running jquery version use index_jquery_version.php file. One can access index.php from which it will show the different version of demo.

Thanks and Hope it helps :)
